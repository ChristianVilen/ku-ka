# Selected Area Screen Capture (app name Ku-Ka (kuvakaappaus))

## Overview

A lightweight macOS app to replace the default `Shift+Command+4` selected area screenshot functionality. The app will:

- Capture a user-selected area of the screen.
- Capture the full screen instantly with `Shift+Command+3` (captures the screen where the cursor is, with flash animation).
- Multi-monitor support — dims all screens, captures from the screen where the cursor is.
- Save the screenshot to `~/Screenshots/`.
- Copy the screenshot to the clipboard.
- Floating thumbnail preview after capture — click to annotate with freehand drawing.
- Delete screenshots from thumbnail or editor — removes file and clears clipboard.
- Keep Awake — prevent the Mac from idle-sleeping from the menu bar, for a preset time (30m/1h/2h/4h) or until turned off, with an optional "keep display awake" preference.
- Window tiling — `Ctrl+Option+Left/Right/Return/C` snaps the active window to the left half, right half, full screen, or center of its display (maximize toggles back to the previous frame; center keeps the window's size and does nothing when it's already maximize-sized). Pressing Left/Right again on an already-snapped window sends it to the same half of the next screen in that direction (wrapping — with two monitors, either direction reaches the other one). Stage Manager-aware, with a menu toggle to turn the hotkeys off.
- Clipboard history — `Shift+Command+C` opens a glass panel listing recorded clipboard items, newest first; typing filters, arrow keys select, Enter pastes into whatever app had focus. For rich text (RTF/HTML), Enter opens a chooser: paste with formatting or without, with "without" pre-selected. Records plain text, rich text, and images, including Ku-Ka's own screenshots — deleting a screenshot removes its history entry too. In-memory only, capped at 100 items and ~100 MB of image bytes; concealed/transient/auto-generated pasteboard content (password managers) is never recorded. A menu toggle stops polling, clears the history, and releases the hotkey.

`KuKa/` and `KuKaTests/` are file-system synchronized folders. Xcode compiles every
file in them, so adding, renaming, or deleting a source file changes nothing in
`KuKa.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`. Do not add file entries to the project file by hand.
To keep a file out of the build, put it outside these two folders.

### Key Classes

| Class | Responsibility |
|-------|---------------|
| `AppDelegate` | Menu bar icon, launch-at-login toggle, Window Tiling toggle (persisted as `windowTilingEnabled`), thumbnail duration setting, orchestrates the capture flow, multi-monitor overlay management; owns `ClipboardHistoryController` and `ClipboardPanel`, wires the Clipboard History menu toggle (persisted as `clipboardHistoryEnabled`) to enable/disable and dismiss the panel; and wires `ImageStore.onDeletedHash` to `controller.removeItem(hash:)` so deleting a screenshot drops its history row |
| `HotkeyManager` | `CGEvent.tapCreate` to intercept the screenshot combos (`Shift+Command+3/4`), the clipboard history combo (`Shift+Command+C`) while clipboard history is enabled, and, while tiling is enabled, the tiling combos (`Ctrl+Option+Left/Right/Return/C`); routes everything through a single `onAction` callback with the `HotkeyAction` enum |
| `OverlayWindow` | Full-screen borderless `NSWindow` covering each display |
| `SelectionView` | Mouse drag selection, dimmed background, real-time dimensions label |
| `CaptureManager` | Protocol-based DI (`FileManaging`, `ClipboardManaging`, `ScreenCapturing`), PNG save to `~/Screenshots/`, clipboard copy, screenshot deletion |
| `FlashView` | White flash animation overlay on screen after full-screen capture |
| `ThumbnailPanel` | Floating preview in bottom-right corner, configurable auto-dismiss (3s/5s/forever), click to open editor, delete button to remove screenshot |
| `ThumbnailStackManager` | Manages multiple thumbnail panels: stacking (max 5), positioning, timer logic (solo=timed, multi=persist), animated repositioning on dismiss |
| `CombineButton` | Floating "Combine" button with liquid glass visual, appears between adjacent thumbnails for merging two screenshots into one |
| `DrawingView` | Freehand red drawing on screenshot, undo support, composites final image |
| `EditorWindow` | Centered modal for annotation with Undo, Delete, and Done buttons |
| `WakeSession` | Pure, side-effect-free session model; all time queries take an explicit `now` |
| `WakeManager` | Drives the `SleepPreventing` seam (IOKit power assertion), expiry timer, `keepDisplayAwake` mode |
| `KeepAwakeController` | Keep Awake AppKit glue: builds the menu section, per-second countdown, persists the display preference, expiry notification |
| `KeepAwakePanelView` | Custom `NSView` menu item: status line, duration chips (segmented control), "Keep display awake" checkbox |
| `WindowTilingController` | `@MainActor`, thin orchestrator: reads the focused window, picks its screen, asks `TilingLayoutEngine` what to do, carries it out through `WindowControlling`; owns the pre-maximize saved-frame map |
| `TilingLayoutEngine` | Pure, stateless layout math: target frame for left-half/right-half/maximize/center, whether a maximize should move the window or restore its pre-maximize frame, whether a second half-press should hop to the adjacent screen, and whether a center press should do nothing (window already maximize-sized) |
| `TilingScreenRules` | Screen-related rules: counts how many on-screen windows "belong" to a given screen (for the Stage Manager strip check), picks which screen a window should be tiled against, and picks the adjacent screen a second half-press hops to (ordered by horizontal center, wrapping) |
| `StageManagerDetector` | Reads whether Stage Manager is turned on, fresh on every access (no caching, since the user can toggle it any time) |
| `AccessibilityWindowControl` | Accessibility-API glue: reads the focused window's frame and moves/resizes it; converts between AX (top-left origin) and NS (bottom-left origin) coordinates |
| `WindowListProvider` | Lists on-screen, layer-0 windows (excluding Ku-Ka's own) via `CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo`, converted to NS coordinates |
| `ScreenCoordinates` | Shared vertical-flip math used by both `WindowListProvider` and `AccessibilityWindowControl` for CG/AX ↔ NS coordinate conversion |
| `PermissionsManager` | `@MainActor` single source of truth for the two TCC permissions: `refresh()` re-reads `AXIsProcessTrusted()`/`CGPreflightScreenCaptureAccess()`, request methods deep-link into the right System Settings pane (and trigger the system prompt — for Accessibility only on the first request, see below), 0.5s polling while onboarding is open |
| `HotkeyHealthMonitor` | `@MainActor` owner of the hotkey-health question. Polls raw injected probes on one 5s timer: `AXIsProcessTrusted()`, `HotkeyManager.isDelivering`, and the secure-input probes (behind its internal `SecureInputMonitor` seam). `state: HotkeyHealth` is one cause in causal "fix this first" order — `noPermission` > `tapDead` > `secureInputStuck(holderName:)` — with a 10s dwell on `tapDead` so watchdog-healed blips never flash. `onChange` drives the menu warning lines and the red warning-corner dot |
| `SecureInputMonitor` | Internal seam of `HotkeyHealthMonitor` (no other consumer; the health monitor drives `refresh()`). Reads `IsSecureEventInputEnabled()`; a grab held for 10s straight (`stuckThreshold`) flips `state` to `.blocked(holderName:)` — the holder resolved once, at block time, from the session dictionary's `kCGSSessionSecureInputPID`, because a quit app can leak the grab and a later lookup would lose its name |
| `OnboardingWindowController` | Dedicated `NSWindow` (AppKit, no storyboard) shown at launch while a permission is missing — a welcome page first, then the permission checklist. The menu's "Permissions…" and a capture blocked on a missing grant open it straight on the checklist. Flips the app to `.regular` activation policy while open, back to `.accessory` on close |
| `ClipboardItem` | Pure value type: kind is `.text(plain, rtf: Data?, html: Data?)` or `.image(png: Data, pixelSize)`, plus a content hash from the shared `ContentHash` — the same one `ImageStore` records per file, so the two agree on identity — copy date, `hasRichFlavors`, `byteCost`, and a one-line `previewLabel` built once up front |
| `ContentHash` | Neutral namespace for the SHA-256 hex digest (CryptoKit) that `ClipboardItem` uses as its dedupe key and `ImageStore` records for each PNG it copies |
| `PasteboardImage` | Neutral namespace holding the one image-write rule — PNG always, a TIFF representation alongside it only under a pixel ceiling — plus that ceiling's default. `ImageStore` and `SystemPasteboard` both write images to `NSPasteboard.general` and both call this instead of carrying their own copy |
| `ClipboardHistory` | Pure model, no AppKit: ordered list (newest first), dedupe-to-top on a matching content hash, a 100-item cap and a ~100 MB image-byte cap (each evicts oldest-first, text is never evicted by the byte cap), a single-item 50 MB refusal, case-insensitive filter, remove-by-hash, clear |
| `ClipboardPasteboard` | `SystemPasteboard` adapts `NSPasteboard.general` to `PasteboardReading`/`PasteboardWriting`: skips content carrying an `org.nspasteboard` concealed/transient/auto-generated marker, reads an image (`.png`, else `.tiff` re-encoded) or text plus `.rtf`/`.html`, writes plain-only or plain-plus-rich flavors and returns the change count the write itself produced (for self-write suppression). `CGEventKeystrokeSender` sends the synthetic Cmd+V (`kVK_ANSI_V`, `.maskCommand` only). The TIFF ceiling is an init parameter defaulting to `PasteboardImage.defaultTIFFMaxPixels` |
| `ClipboardHistoryController` | `@MainActor`. Runs a 0.5s main-queue poll against `PasteboardReading`, owns the `ClipboardHistory` and every piece of state the panel renders (visible items, selection, list/chooser mode). Handles Enter (paste, or open the formatting chooser for rich text), Esc, filtering, the paste hand-off (close panel → write → keystroke after a short settle delay, adopting the write's own change count as the new baseline), `enable()`/`disable()` (stop polling + clear), and `removeItem(hash:)` for screenshot deletions. Every panel entry point is mode-aware here — the panel forwards Enter, Esc, arrows, clicks and typing blindly and never second-guesses what the current mode allows |
| `ClipboardPanel` | Subclass of `FloatingPanel`, `.nonactivatingPanel` + `canBecomeKey` so it takes keystrokes without activating Ku-Ka. `NSGlassEffectView` background, a search field over an `NSTableView` list; renders whatever `ClipboardHistoryController` currently says to show and forwards key events back to it. View only — no history, no `NSPasteboard` access |
| `Metrics` / `ClipboardHistoryRowView` / `ClipboardHistoryCellView` | `ClipboardRowViews.swift`: every size and inset the panel draws with, the inset rounded selection bar (the full-width system band fights glass), and one row's icon + one-line label + trailing image thumbnail |
| `ClipboardThumbnailCache` | Decodes an item's PNG at thumbnail size through ImageIO — the full-resolution bitmap is never built — and keeps only the small result, keyed by content hash. Cleared on dismiss, so a deleted screenshot can't come back |

### Flow

```
Shift+Cmd+3 → HotkeyManager (suppresses event) → AppDelegate.startFullScreenCapture()
→ Detect cursor screen → CaptureManager.captureFullScreen(screen) → Save PNG + Copy clipboard
→ FlashView.flash(on: screen) → ThumbnailPanel shown (bottom-right)

Shift+Cmd+4 → HotkeyManager (suppresses event) → AppDelegate.startCapture()
→ OverlayWindows shown on all screens → User drags selection on cursor's screen
→ SelectionView reports CGRect → All overlays dismissed → 50ms delay
→ CaptureManager.capture(rect, screen) → Save PNG + Copy clipboard
→ ThumbnailPanel shown (bottom-right, 5s timeout) → Click thumbnail → EditorWindow opens
→ Freehand drawing → Done → Overwrite PNG + Update clipboard

Ctrl+Opt+Left/Right/Return/C → HotkeyManager (suppresses event; skipped entirely when the
"Window Tiling" menu toggle is off — keys pass through) → WindowTilingController.tile(action)
→ TilingLayoutEngine.resolve(action, ...) decides move-and-save, restore, screen hop, or nothing
→ AccessibilityWindowControl.setFrame(...) moves the window

Shift+Cmd+C → HotkeyManager (suppresses event; skipped entirely when the "Clipboard History"
menu toggle is off — key passes through) → AppDelegate.toggleClipboardPanel()
→ ClipboardPanel.show() (non-activating panel; the previously focused app keeps focus)
→ type to filter / arrows to select / Enter to paste (or open the with/without-formatting
chooser for rich text) → panel closes → ClipboardHistoryController writes the pasteboard
→ synthetic Cmd+V sent after a ~50ms delay
```

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Selected Area Capture** — Triggered by `Shift+Command+4`, user selects rectangular area with visual feedback (crosshair, dimensions).
2. **Full Screen Capture** — Triggered by `Shift+Command+3`, instantly captures the screen where the cursor is with a flash animation.
2. **Save to Screenshots Folder** — PNG saved to `~/Screenshots/` as `Screenshot_YYYY-MM-DD_at_HH-MM-SS.png`.
3. **Copy to Clipboard** — Captured image automatically copied to clipboard.
4. **User Experience** — No persistent window, menu bar agent only. Floating thumbnail preview after capture.

### Technical Requirements

- **Language**: Swift 5, macOS 26.0+ (raised for `NSGlassEffectView`, used by the clipboard history panel)
- **Project format**: Xcode 16 synchronized folders (object version 77) — opening the project needs Xcode 16 or later
- **Frameworks**: AppKit, CoreGraphics, ScreenCaptureKit, ServiceManagement, ApplicationServices (Accessibility API for window tiling), ImageIO (clipboard-panel thumbnails), CryptoKit (SHA-256 content hashing, via `ContentHash`)
- **Permissions**: Accessibility (covers the CGEvent tap, AX window move/resize, and the clipboard history hotkey + synthetic paste — no extra grant for any of them), Screen Recording (ScreenCaptureKit)
- **Launch at Login**: `SMAppService.mainApp.register()` / `unregister()`
- **Build flag**: the KuKa app target sets `OTHER_SWIFT_FLAGS = "-enable-upcoming-feature IsolatedDefaultValues"`. This exists because `WindowTilingController`'s init has default argument values (`AccessibilityWindowControl()`, etc.) that construct `@MainActor` types, and under Swift 5 language mode the compiler otherwise treats those defaults as evaluated outside the actor. The flag becomes redundant once the project moves to Swift 6 language mode, where this is the default behavior.

---

## Future Features

- **Window Capture** (`Shift+Cmd+4` then `Space`) — click a window to capture just that window
- **Screen Recording** — capture video of a selected area or full screen

## Implementation Notes

### Keyboard Shortcut
- Uses `CGEvent.tapCreate` at `.cgSessionEventTap` to intercept key-down events globally.
- Screenshot combos: keyCode `0x14` (3 key) and `0x15` (4 key) with `.maskShift` + `.maskCommand`.
- Clipboard history combo: keyCode `0x08` (C) with `.maskShift` + `.maskCommand`, and `.maskControl`/`.maskAlternate` both absent. The tiling "center" combo below uses the same key code (`Ctrl+Option+C`), but the two can never both match, because each one requires a modifier the other forbids. Control and Option are ruled out here for a different reason: to let chords with extra modifiers, such as Ctrl+Shift+Cmd+C, pass through instead of counting as ours.
- Tiling combos: keyCode `0x7B` (Left), `0x7C` (Right), `0x24` (Return), `0x08` (C) with `.maskControl` + `.maskAlternate`. Command and Shift must be absent so these can't collide with the screenshot combos. Arrow keys carry extra flags (`.maskSecondaryFn`, `.maskNumericPad`), so the check is "required flags present, forbidden flags absent" rather than an exact match.
- All matches route through one `onAction` closure with the `HotkeyAction` enum (`.captureArea`, `.captureFullScreen`, `.tile(TilingAction)`, `.showClipboardHistory`).
- The `tilingEnabled` flag gates the tiling combos, and `clipboardHistoryEnabled` gates the clipboard history combo the same way: while off, the combo isn't matched at all and passes through to other apps. Screenshot combos are unaffected by either flag.
- Returns `nil` to suppress the system screenshot tool.
- Requires Accessibility permission. `HotkeyManager` no longer checks or prompts for it — `AppDelegate` starts the tap (via `PermissionsManager` status) as soon as Accessibility is granted, with no relaunch needed; the onboarding window handles the prompting.
- Hotkeys can die silently three ways, and `HotkeyHealthMonitor` owns the question: Accessibility permission missing (no tap can exist), the tap disabled by the system past the watchdog's healing (`HotkeyManager.isDelivering` is the probe — `isRunning` only says a tap object is installed), and secure keyboard input (a focused password field, held via `EnableSecureEventInput`) starving every CGEvent tap — a crashed or misbehaving app can leak that grab indefinitely, and nothing can release it from outside (the user locks and unlocks the screen, or logs out). `AppDelegate` renders the monitor's state as warning lines at the top of the status menu with per-cause remedies plus the warning-corner dot: red = hotkeys dead (any cause), orange = only Screen Recording missing.

### Screen Capture
- Overlay window is dismissed before capture to exclude it from the screenshot.
- 50ms delay after dismissal ensures the overlay is fully gone.
- `CGWindowListCreateImage` with `.optionOnScreenOnly` and `.bestResolution`.
- Coordinate conversion from NSView (bottom-left origin) to CGDisplay (top-left origin).

### Selection Overlay
- `OverlayWindow` at `.screenSaver` level, borderless, transparent.
- `SelectionView` draws dimmed background (30% black), clears selected rect, white border, monospaced dimensions label.
- Escape key cancels selection.
- Zero-size selections are ignored.

## Testing

### Architecture

`CaptureManager` uses protocol-based dependency injection for testability:

| Protocol | Real Implementation | Responsibility |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| `FileManaging` | `FileManager` | Directory creation, file writing, file deletion |
| `ClipboardManaging` | `SystemClipboard` | Pasteboard operations, clipboard clearing |
| `ScreenCapturing` | `SystemScreenCapture` | `CGWindowListCreateImage` wrapper |

No `KuKaUITests` target exists yet; `AppDelegate`'s `--uitesting` guard (below) is ready for one but nothing currently exercises it.

### Test-Mode Guard

When running under XCTest, `AppDelegate` skips `setupPermissions()` entirely to avoid permission prompts — no TCC checks, no onboarding window, no warning badge on the status icon, and (because the event tap only starts once Accessibility reports granted) no hotkey registration either. The same `isTesting` check also skips `clipboardHistory.enable()` at startup, so a test run never polls the real pasteboard and never ingests whatever the developer happens to have copied:
- Unit tests: detected via `XCTestConfigurationFilePath` environment variable
- UI tests: detected via the `--uitesting` launch argument (no UI-test target currently exists)

### Running Tests

- **Xcode**: `Cmd+U` runs the unit test suite
- **CLI**: `xcodebuild -project KuKa.xcodeproj -scheme KuKa test`

### Unit Test Coverage

- `capture()` returns result on success, nil on screen capture failure
- Screenshots directory is created via `FileManaging` protocol
- Clipboard copy is called on successful capture, skipped on failure
- Coordinate conversion from NSView (bottom-left) to CGDisplay (top-left)
- File naming format: `Screenshot_YYYY-MM-DD_at_HH-MM-SS.png`
- `saveAnnotated()` writes file and updates clipboard
- `deleteScreenshot()` removes file and clears clipboard
- Keep Awake: activation passes the display-awake flag to the preventer; toggling it mid-session swaps the assertion without ending the session; timed sessions expire and fire callbacks; the menu panel reflects state and the display preference persists across launches
- Tiling layout math, the maximize/restore toggle (including apps that snap window sizes), the second-press screen hop, and center's move/no-op decision (`TilingLayoutEngine`)
- Screen-membership, screen-picking, and adjacent-screen (hop) rules (`TilingScreenRules`), and the controller's saved-frame map behavior across save/restore/failure plus center pass-through (`WindowTilingController`)
- Hotkey routing (`HotkeyManager`): tiling combos swallowed while enabled, passed through while disabled; the clipboard history combo swallowed while enabled and passed through while disabled, including with an extra Control or Option held down; screenshot combos work in every state
- Permissions (`PermissionsManager`): `refresh()` reads the injected probes; `onChange` fires only on a real status change; the 0.5s poll and the app-activation monitor pick up a grant without a manual refresh; the Settings deep link tries the modern pane id first and falls back to the legacy one; the Accessibility prompt is shown on the first request only, in this run and in later ones, while the Settings pane opens every time
- Clipboard history model (`ClipboardHistory`): adding puts the newest item first; a duplicate content hash moves the existing item to the top instead of growing the list; the 101st item evicts the oldest; the image-byte budget evicts oldest images first and leaves text alone; an item over the single-item byte cap is refused; the filter matches text content and image labels case-insensitively; remove-by-hash and clear both work; `hasRichFlavors` is true only when RTF or HTML is present
- Clipboard history controller (`ClipboardHistoryController`) polling and state, against a fake pasteboard and a fake keystroke sender: a change-count bump reads and adds one item, an unchanged count reads nothing, marked/oversized/unsupported content from the reader is skipped; `enable()`/`disable()` start and stop the poll and clear the history; a reported screenshot hash drops its item
- Clipboard history controller paste handling: Enter pastes plain text and images immediately, and opens the formatting chooser for rich text; the chooser's two rows paste with and without formatting; Esc in the chooser restores the prior list selection (clamped if items were removed while it was open); a paste moves the pasted item to the top of the history and keeps its rich flavors even when the paste itself was plain-only; the poll right after our own paste does not re-record it (self-write suppression, via adopting the write's own change count as the new baseline)
- Settings (`Settings`): `clipboardHistoryEnabled` defaults to true and persists, same as the other toggles
- Screenshot deletion (`ImageStore`): remembers the content hash of the PNG behind each saved file; `delete(at:)` reports that hash through `onDeletedHash`, nothing for an unknown URL, and both hashes when a screenshot was re-saved after annotation
- Status menu (`StatusMenu`): the Clipboard History checkbox writes `clipboardHistoryEnabled`, fires its toggle callback, and flips its own checkmark, same as Window Tiling; the Features section lists "⌘⇧C to open clipboard history"; the hotkey-health warning lines appear once per state (no duplication on repeated updates) with per-cause wording and remedy — holder name or "another app" for stuck secure input, permission and dead-tap variants — switch when the cause changes, and disappear on `.healthy`
- Hotkey health (`HotkeyHealthMonitor`): each probe failure maps to its state; `noPermission` outranks everything and `tapDead` outranks `secureInputStuck`; `tapDead` reports only after 10s of consecutive dead reads, and revival or a missing permission resets that dwell; a stuck grab reports with the holder name; `onChange` fires only on transitions; the poll timer picks changes up without a manual `refresh()`
- Secure input (`SecureInputMonitor`, internal seam): a grab held past the 10s threshold reports `.blocked` with the holder name (captured at block time, surviving the holder quitting) and fires `onChange` once; a momentary grab never warns; release after blocked clears and fires `onChange`; an unresolvable holder reports nil

### Keep Awake implementation

- `IOKitSleepPreventer` creates an IOKit power assertion: `PreventUserIdleDisplaySleep` when "Keep display awake" is on (display and system both stay awake), `PreventUserIdleSystemSleep` when off (system stays awake, display sleeps and locks on its normal schedule).
- Lid-close sleep is never prevented; the menu hint says so.
- The display-awake preference lives in `UserDefaults` under `keepDisplayAwake`, default on.
- The menu UI is an inline custom-view panel (no submenu): one row of duration chips plus the checkbox; Turn Off appears below while a session is active.

### Permissions implementation

- The Accessibility grant needs the system prompt (`AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions` with `kAXTrustedCheckOptionPrompt`) at least once: that call is what puts Ku-Ka in the Accessibility list. Opening the pane by itself adds nothing, and the user would find no row to switch on.
- After that first time the prompt only repeats what the onboarding window says, as a modal on top of it, so `requestAccessibility()` shows it once and then only deep-links. The flag lives in `UserDefaults` under `didPromptForAccessibility`.
- Screen Recording keeps prompting on every request: `CGRequestScreenCaptureAccess()` is not a modal of the same kind, and macOS re-asks for this grant about once a month anyway.
- To test the first-run path again: `tccutil reset Accessibility com.kuka.screenshot` and `defaults delete com.kuka.screenshot didPromptForAccessibility`.

### Window tiling implementation

- All layout math works on `visibleFrame` (menu bar and Dock excluded) in NS (bottom-left) coordinates.
- Stage Manager insets on maximize: 7% of visible width on the left (`stageManagerLeftInsetFraction`), 2% of visible *height* on top, bottom, and right (`stageManagerEdgeInsetFraction`; height-based on all three so the gaps are equal in points). Applied only when Stage Manager is on **and** the screen has 2+ windows — with one window the strip hides itself. Half-screen tiling gets no inset.
- Maximize/restore toggle: restore fires when the window's current frame matches the previously *achieved* frame (not the requested one) within 2 pt (`frameMatchTolerance`). This handles apps like Terminal that snap sizes to a character grid.
- Screen hop: a Left/Right press on a window already sitting at that half's target (within the same 2 pt tolerance) moves it to the same half of the adjacent screen in that direction. Screens are ordered by horizontal center (`TilingScreenRules.adjacentScreenIndex`) and the step wraps, so with two monitors either direction reaches the other one. Judged against the ideal target, not an achieved frame — an app that snaps its size by more than 2 pt never hops and just gets the half re-applied (accepted).
- Center (`Ctrl+Option+C`): moves the window to the middle of the visible frame keeping its size. Does nothing when the window's size already matches the maximize target's size within 2 pt (position is ignored); with the Stage Manager strip taking space, "maximize size" means the inset stage target.
- Screen rules: a window "belongs" to a screen when at least 50% of its own area intersects it; Stage Manager's own windows (owner `"WindowManager"`) and zero-area windows are excluded from the count. A window is tiled against the screen it overlaps the most; ties go to the lowest index, and with no overlap the controller falls back to `NSScreen.main`, then the first screen.
- AX safety: a 0.5 s `AXUIElementSetMessagingTimeout` cap stops a hung app from stalling the main thread; attributes are checked with `AXUIElementIsAttributeSettable` before writing; position is written before and after size for reliable edge snapping; the achieved frame is re-read and returned. Ku-Ka refuses to tile its own windows (pid check). Failures are only `NSLog`ged — no user feedback.
- The `windowTilingEnabled` `UserDefaults` key defaults to on. `WindowTilingController.savedFrames` entries for closed windows are never cleaned up (accepted for v1).
- `StageManagerDetector` reads `com.apple.WindowManager` / `GloballyEnabled` fresh on every access; this works because the app is unsandboxed.
