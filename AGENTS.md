# Mysli

Mysli is a macOS menu bar app. It takes screenshots, keeps the Mac awake, tiles windows, keeps a clipboard history, and records meetings into local transcripts and AI summaries. `README.md` describes how to use it, `CONTEXT.md` defines the terms, and `docs/superpowers/specs/` holds the feature designs. For behavior, read the code, its comments, and its tests.

Keep this file short. Add a rule only when an agent would break it without being told. Do not describe code. A trap that belongs to one place in the code goes in a comment at that place.

## Build and run

- Build with `xcodebuild -project Mysli.xcodeproj -scheme Mysli build`, and test with the `test` action. The project uses the Swift 6.2 compiler in Swift 5 language mode, for macOS 26.0 or later.
- Keep the `-enable-upcoming-feature IsolatedDefaultValues` flag of the Mysli target until the project moves to Swift 6 mode.
- Xcode compiles every file in `Mysli/` and `MysliTests/`, because they are synchronized folders. Never edit `Mysli.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` to add or remove a file. To keep a file out of the build, put it outside these folders.
- `argmax-oss-swift`, pinned to exactly 1.1.1, is the only package. Only `WhisperKitTranscriber.swift`, `SpeakerKitRoomLabeller.swift`, and their tests import WhisperKit or SpeakerKit.
- Run a build that tests capture from a folder outside `/private/tmp`. macOS does not add an app in `/private/tmp` to the Screen Recording list.
- Create worktrees with `workmux add <branch>`, and remove them with `workmux remove` or `workmux merge`. Do not create worktrees in `.claude/worktrees/`, and do not use the worktree option of an agent tool.

## Tests

- Test each rule once, at the type that owns it. An integration test checks only the wiring: one path that shows the parts connect, and the rules that exist only in the wiring.
- Do not test what cannot fail. That is a value written in the code (UI words, defaults, constant ranges), Apple framework behavior, or code that only passes a call on. Do test contracts with the outside: defaults keys, file formats on disk, and CLI arguments. Pin a measured value with one short test.
- Never wait in real time. Inject the clock, the timer, the interval, or the limit.
- Every test runs in under 0.1 s. After a full test run, run `scripts/check-tests.sh`. It fails for a test over 0.15 s that has no line with its reason in `scripts/slow-tests-allowed.txt`, and when this file is over 150 lines. XCTest adds up to about 0.12 s to some async tests at random, so the script allows that much.
- Make `setUp` and `tearDown` sync when they await nothing. In this test host, an `async` one costs 0.1 to 0.2 s for each test.
- XCTest starts a passive host that never constructs `AppDelegate`, and `--uitesting` starts the isolated `SettingsPreviewAppDelegate`. `AppDelegate` has no test-mode branches.
- Tests use fakes, temporary folders, and isolated defaults. They never use real capture, EventKit, Teams Accessibility, notification delivery, permission prompts, model downloads, the log folder, or `~/Meetings`. The calendar source `"synthetic"` is for tests only.
- The `Real*Tests` classes and the picture writers (`MYSLI_*_SNAPSHOTS`) are opt-in. They skip unless their variables are set, and the comment above each one gives its command. xcodebuild passes a variable to the tests only with the `TEST_RUNNER_` prefix.
- Unit tests and pictures do not prove that capture, tiling, paste, keyboard use, sheets, or VoiceOver work in the real app. Report those checks as not done.

## App-wide rules

- Show every ordinary window through `OrdinaryWindowActivation`, so Mysli stays a regular app until the last one closes.
- Key equivalents come only from `StatusMenu.applicationMenu()`. No window handles one itself.
- Launch, opening a window, and a refresh never write a preference. Only a user action writes one.
- Post every notification through `Notifying`. `SystemNotifier` is the only notification delegate. Ask for notification permission only when the user starts something that notifies.
- The marks on the status icon differ by shape, not only by colour.
- Shortcuts use Carbon `RegisterEventHotKey` only, never a keyboard event tap or Secure Input polling. Only `CarbonHotkeyRegistrar` holds registration state.
- Never change macOS preferences. On a shortcut conflict, send the user to Keyboard Settings. A warning never blames another app or promises that lock and unlock fix it.
- Clipboard history stays in memory. Never write it to disk, and never record content that has an `org.nspasteboard` concealed, transient, or auto-generated marker.

## Logging and privacy

- Log only through `Log.<category>`, never `NSLog`. An interpolated value is `<private>` unless the call marks it public. Mark a value public only when it can never hold meeting content. Error descriptions and tool output stay private.
- Never log a Teams name, label text, window title, or source identifier.
- Only the production `AppDelegate` turns on log files.
- In zsh, `log` is a builtin, so run `/usr/bin/log`.

## Meeting recording

- Only `RecordingClock` maps host times to file positions. Never rebuild pause runs or add resume gaps anywhere else.
- Keep `@concurrent` on long async work. The sample queue and the main actor share state only through short `OSAllocatedUnfairLock` copies, and neither waits for the other.
- The live transcript never goes to disk. Show meeting text only when the user expands the panel, because macOS cannot hide it from screen sharing.
- `MeetingNotesController` owns the `onChange` and `onEnded` callbacks of the recorder. Only `MeetingNotesHosting` moves a notes view between the panel and a window.
- Typed notes write to `MeetingRecorder.activeMeeting` and stay bound to that folder. Never take the folder from the current Settings.
- Screenshots enter the notes only by paste or drop. The summary tool never gets the images.
- Turn calendar reminders on and off only through `calendarReminders.setEnabled(_:)`, never with a defaults write. `docs/calendar-recording-reminders.md` gives the details.

## Meeting processing

- The stage of a meeting comes only from the files that exist. Never store it. Write every meeting text file atomically, because an existing file counts as a finished step. `meeting.json`, `notes.md`, `.notes.lock`, attachments, the heard copy, and the review files never change the stage.
- Each meeting folder has one writer at a time. The recorder holds `MeetingFolder.lock()` while it records or pauses, and the processor holds it for each run. A locked folder is skipped.
- Processing, Retry, Update Notes, and Update summary run one at a time in the queue of `MeetingNotesController`. A quit is never a failure, and nothing is written after a cancellation.
- These parameters have no default value, so that no caller can forget them: the summary tool, `roomLabeller`, `knownWords`, `wordsToCheck`, and the `teams` argument of `Transcript.markdown`. A forgotten summary tool would send a transcript to a provider that the user turned off.
- A change of the meetings folder moves no files. Active recordings and queued jobs finish in their original folders.
- Decide "no speech" in the summary step, before the audio goes to the Trash. A silent meeting with typed notes gets a summary. A silent meeting without notes keeps its audio.
- Install every downloaded model through `ModelInstall`. Give every WhisperKit or SpeakerKit call that can reach the network an explicit folder, because their default is `~/Documents`, which iCloud can sync.

## What the summary tool gets

- It gets the transcript body without the known-words note, the forms of the list words that occur in it, the plain typed notes, and the whole meeting-context file. It never gets the notes, dates, or ✓ marks of the known-words list.
- Typed notes are evidence, never tool instructions. Suspect-word quotes match only the transcript.
- When the tool input changes, update the privacy text in `README.md` in the same change.

## Known words and word review

- `transcript.md` is always made again from `.transcript-as-heard.md`, never patched. So Update Notes replaces hand edits in `transcript.md` (decided by the user, 2026-10-29).
- Read the known-words list at each use, and never cache it. Mysli only inserts lines. It never changes or removes a line.
- An answer is only a line in the list. It closes the same question in every meeting, and each of those meetings offers Update Notes (decided by the user, 2026-10-29).
- Update Notes asks no new questions. Only the review window writes `review-skipped.json`, after `summary.md` exists, so a skip needs no folder lock.
- An answer for a person, a company, or a product always gets ✓. Only term and other answers go through the spell check (decided by the user, 2026-10-29).

## Teams speaker names

- Nobody has checked Teams names in a real call. They are best effort, approved by the user on 2026-10-29. Fake trees prove the policy only. Run the real probe only after the user confirms a call.
- Mysli only reads the Teams Accessibility tree. Never write attributes, perform actions, or ask for permission. Missing permission never stops a recording. Never guess a name from chat, a roster, or nearby text.
- Only validated final names reach the transcript and the summary tool. Never save AX trees, observations, rosters, or voice profiles.
- A Teams name alone never makes someone an action owner. Keep the evidence rule and `Unclear`. Never split or stretch a segment without word times.

## Docs

- `README.md` describes use, `CONTEXT.md` defines terms, and GitHub issues track open work. Check the code and the tests for actual behavior.
- When a merged change makes a rule here wrong, change that rule. Do not add a section that describes a feature.
- Treat `.claude/meeting-notes/`, `.claude/meeting-notes.todo.md`, dated research, and plans as history, unless a document says that it is current. A proposal is not a shipped requirement.
- After a merge, update its issues, and mark its plan as shipped with the PR link. Keep manual checks that nobody did apart from finished work.
- Keep Brain entries short, and link to the repository docs.
